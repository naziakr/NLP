(1) Think stats is a free book to study statistics (https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)

This book has references to many websites from where you can download free datasets. You are an NLP engineer working for some company and you want to collect all dataset websites from this book. To keep exercise simple you are given a paragraph from this book and you want to grab all urls from this paragraph using spacy

Look for data to help you address the question. Governments are good
sources because data from public research is often freely available. Good
places to start include http://www.data.gov/, and http://www.science.
gov/, and in the United Kingdom, http://data.gov.uk/.
Two of my favorite data sets are the General Social Survey at http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/, 
and the European Social Survey at http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/.

nlp = spacy.blank("en")

doc = nlp(text)

url = []
for token in doc:
    if token.like_url:
        url.append(token)

print(url)

(2) Extract all money transaction from below sentence along with currency. Output should be,

two $

500 €

transactions = "Tony gave two $ to Peter, Bruce gave 500 € to Steve"

line = nlp(transactions)

for token in line:
    if token.like_num and line[token.i+1].is_currency:
        print(line[token.i: token.i+2])
