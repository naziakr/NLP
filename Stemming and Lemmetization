Exercise1:

Convert these list of words into base form using Stemming and Lemmatization and observe the transformations Write a short note on the words that have different base words using stemming and Lemmatization

#using stemming in nltk
lst_words = ['running', 'painting', 'walking', 'dressing', 'likely', 'children', 'whom', 'good', 'ate', 'fishing']
for word in lst_words:
    print(word, "|", stemmer.stem(word))
running | run
painting | paint
walking | walk
dressing | dress
likely | like
children | children
whom | whom
good | good
ate | ate
fishing | fish
#using lemmatization in spacy
​
doc = nlp("running painting walking dressing likely children who good ate fishing")
a
for token in doc:
    print(token, "|", token.lemma_)
running | run
painting | painting
walking | walk
dressing | dress
likely | likely
children | child
who | who
good | good
ate | eat
fishing | fishing
Exercise2:

convert the given text into it's base form using both stemming and lemmatization

text = """Latha is very multi talented girl.She is good at many skills like dancing, running, singing, playing.She also likes eating Pav Bhagi. she has a 
habit of fishing and swimming too.Besides all this, she is a wonderful at cooking too.
